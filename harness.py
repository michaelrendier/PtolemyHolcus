harness.py — the Monad's harness.

The interim API surface between the Monad, the repos' own engines/tools, and
whatever is asking for content (the curses UI, eventually PtolemyDesktop).

NOT PtolBus, and deliberately kept apart in the code, not just in name: this
file's `toolset_registry` is "the currently populated toolbox" — capability
in, a Face/tool out. PtolBus (Pharos.PtolBus / FaceRegistry) is a different
future thing entirely — the day the Monad is handed the bus itself, it stops
reaching OUT for tools and BECOMES the desktop's own mechanic (native window
control, project context, opening its own windows). That is not a bigger
toolset_registry, it is a different object with different semantics, and it
does not exist here yet on purpose.

Standing rule: nothing above this file talks to a Monad, a repo's engine, or
a repo's tools.py directly. Everything goes through one Harness instance.

Deliberately open-ended and stub-tolerant. Several methods below are TODO on
purpose — the method NAMES and SHAPES are this round's actual deliverable,
not full implementations. Whatever consumes them next (the curses UI) is
what should force their real shape, not speculation now about what they
might need later.

# ── conversational ingest — the standing global protocol ─────────────────
# The Monad's daemon is a PASSIVE OBSERVER on the live conversation: every
# user prompt, and every assistant final-prose response (thinking blocks and
# tool I/O stripped by the caller). What it hears updates the vocabulary +
# knowledge as we go, replacing periodic bulk re-ingestion. Rebalances the
# store toward genuine human usage over time — the last bulk build leaned
# heavily on assistant-written context primers.
#
# Two write channels, weighted by a VECTOR in ONE pass — not two calls over
# the same text. crank.learn(text, weight=w_sem, w_ctx=w_ctx) tokenises once
# and, per word, applies:
#   semantic  β-field   gain  ∝ w_sem   (knowledge depth at the address)
#   context   A-matrix   edge Δ ∝ w_ctx  (co-occurrence topology / word order)
#
# The INPUT CLASS is the monad_english_io.hear() echo axis, named, and it
# picks the point in (w_sem, w_ctx, echo) space:
#   external — the human. User prompts. echo 0, never capped, full weight.
#   internal — the coupled system's own language faculty (assistant prose).
#              echo 1: one loop-hop from world input, so it rides the
#              ECHO_CAP feedback guard and enters down-weighted — heavy on
#              semantics (real terminology), light on context topology.
# echo >= 2 keeps its existing meaning (the monad's own output genuinely
# fed back) and is not produced here.
#   document — committed project documentation (wiki / README / papers),
#              fed off a git POST-commit hook (never push). Authored,
#              canonical text — not the live human voice and not a loop
