sentence_context.py — combining individual word box-kites (wordnet_boxkite.py)
into one sentence-level context object.

Cody, 2026-08-25: "the monad is the roots of the tree, and the leaves are
both the input and output words...lets see what the shape of a simple input
looks like when all the box kites are combined from the individual words
into a 'sentence context'...a higher dimensional order of context."

The combination is NOT a new operation invented for this file — it is PW3
(`spiral_is_additive`, SedenionFactoralRelativity/engine/lineage.py:
`address(p*q) = address(p) + address(q)`) applied to context_code instead of
a plain address. context_code(s) = prod CONTEXT_PRIMES[i] ** vector[i], so
multiplying several synsets' codes together is EXACTLY componentwise-summing
their context_vectors — the same additive law already on record, not a new
one. root_vector below is that sum; root_code is the product, kept in sync
and checked against each other in this file's own smoke test.

WSD (word sense disambiguation) here is a deliberate stub: first WordNet
sense per word (wn.synsets(word)[0]), nothing smarter. That is real, honest
scope-narrowing, not hidden — flagged wherever it matters below.
