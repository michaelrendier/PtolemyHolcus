"""rotary_rerun_boxkite_monad.py — testing internal eyes / external eyes as
one Monad, against real content: the sedenion box-kite algebra AND the
WordNet-driven context composter, fused, not layered.

Cody, 2026-08-25 — the design this file tests, precisely:

  "the internal eyes are only necessary for the internal visual space...the
  external eyes are for the concrete structured reality...(in this
  methodology, the rendering and interacting with external data is paper's
  hands exactly)...the way in which the Mind's Eye interacts with the
  world...to be able to think about whatever session topic, project files,
  computer state etc...remember we don't need whole lots of separate
  layers...all doing work together if the monad does literally all the
  work."

So this file does NOT build a third Eye/Hands pair. `rotary_rerun_monad.py`
already has the real ones — `MindsEye` (reads, snapshot, all-at-once,
never emits, never renders, never touches anything external — the
INTERNAL visual space) and `PapersHands` (writes, ordered emission, ONE
relationship at a time — and per this session's clarification, rendering
and external interaction belong here too, not on some separate output
object). Those are reused directly. `RotaryBoxKiteMonad` below is the one
Monad that holds both and does the work; it does not reimplement them and
does not spin up a second Eye/Hands thread pair alongside them (that would
be exactly the "lots of separate layers" this was a caution against).

THE COMPOSTER, validated against existing code, not just intuition:
`sentence_context.py`'s `root_vector` (individual per-word context_vectors
componentwise-summed into one sentence root) is the SAME operation as
`rotary_rerun_monad.py`'s `Reading.summed_with()` — "product — componentwise
SUM. Vector addition of the magnitudes" — just run at 19 WordNet-relation
dimensions instead of 7 box-kite-strut dimensions. "Composter" is a good
conceptual name for what happens (individual leaf identity genuinely merges
— confirmed by the word-salad order-independence test in Phase 32 — the
same way composting loses individual-leaf identity into one substrate); the
codebase's own precise technical name for the operation is `summed`,
alongside `shared` (gcd/min — the same move `compare_context`'s `shared`
field already makes) and `combined` (lcm/max, not yet built here).

WHAT THIS FILE ACTUALLY TESTS, honestly, with a control:

Two independently-built systems exist in this project — the sedenion/
box-kite algebra (rotary_rerun_monad.py, real, tested, `7:7:7`) and the
WordNet relational-context composter (wordnet_boxkite.py / sentence_
context.py, real, tested, Phase 31/32). They have never been run against
the same input before. This file wires them together and asks a real,
falsifiable question: does a WordNet-context-generated response share MORE
box-kite struts (algebraic proximity, via cam_encode) with its own input
than an unrelated control text does? Measured below, not assumed.
